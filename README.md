# GraphFlow
Visualize max/min path and max/min flow algorithms. I originally created this project to be hosted on Heroku, but unfortunately their free hosting service ended. Users could create, modify, and delete undirected/directed graphs with their associated account. You could also specify terminal/source nodes. I also implemented a Javascript version of the graph simplex algorithm.
